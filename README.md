Todo:
- Add ze data
- Make some kind of taulukko (somewhat ok)
- Bootstrap design stuff
- Mobile friendly  (somewhat ok)

Maybe something for later:
- Wordpress design

Something for  later:
- Think about easier ways of updating data (MAYBE A TABLE GENERATOR) [example: https://divtable.com/generator/]
- The index.html might bee too big and complicated so start looking on some server side solution for showing data


Server side todo:
- ~~Move server from  AMS TO HEL~~
- Look on how to run wordpress on the server (Basically just install it)
