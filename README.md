Todo:
- Webapp optimization that this would run like an independent app like reittiopas for example

Maybe something for later:
- Wordpress design
- Look on how to run wordpress on the server (Basically just install it)

Something for  later:
- Think about easier ways of updating data (MAYBE A TABLE GENERATOR) [example: https://divtable.com/generator/]
- The index.html might bee too big and complicated so start looking on some server side solution for showing data
